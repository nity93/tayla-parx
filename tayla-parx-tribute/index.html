		<h2>Who is Tayla Parx?</h2>
		
		<p>Tayla Parx,real name - Taylor Monet Parks, is a force to be reckoned within the Hollywood industry.</p>
		
		<p>She is a wearer of many hats that ranges from songwriting, singing, to vocal acting but all doing it from her own unique & personal #TaylaMade style.</p>
		
		<p>Unbeknownst to most, Parx was probably in one of your favorite pop artist's songwriting room where she helped co-write some of the biggest hits one recent example being Ariana Grande's latest hit: Thank You Next. Click <a id="wiki-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Songs_written_by_Tayla_Parx" title="A list of songs Tayla Parx has helped write for other artist." target="_blank">here</a> for a more thorough list of the other songs she's cowritten.</p>
		
		<p>She doesn't just write for others though. She writes for herself too, giving her a leg up on most artist. She taught herself how to write when no one wanted to work for her in earlier days.</p>
	
		<h2>What has she been up to recently?</h2>
		
		<p>This year she released her own album titled: 'We need to talk' in which she was finally ready to share her own personal music to the world. From it, she gives her a fans an insider look into the life lessons she's learned over the past few years. This time Tayla isn't behind the scenes capturing the personal message of a famous pop singer to share with his or her fans. She is upfront delivering her own special message to her very own Taylatotts (a special name for her fans). Do yourself a favor and give it a listen to in your free time.</p>
